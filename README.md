# microservices-work--College-Management-System-with-Java
We are the members of Project 12 pursuing Bachelor of Science in Information and Communication Technology with Management (BSc. ICTM) and Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with Systems (BSc ITS) third year. We develop the microservices project based on title College Management System. And below is our short explanation:

INTRODUCTION

Microservices are architectural style that develops a single application as a set of small services. Each service runs in its own process. This approach is designed to improve scalability, reliability, and speed of development and deployment.

Advantages of Micro services
- Scalability
-	Resilience
-	Flexibility

Disadvantages of microservices 
-	Complexity
-	Inter-service communication
-	Testing and Deployment

About the project title

Our group based on the developing microservices with title College Management System (CMS) is a comprehensive solution for managing the operations of a college and these have five services which are Departments, Courses, Students, Teacher and Grade these services are communicate with each other through a well-defined APIs.

Technologies used 
-	Java version 19 using Spring boot framework
-	Database used is MySQL version 8
-	Postman used to test APIs

Role of each service

i. Department

 In department staff can update the details of students taking admissions. The students are categorized by their departments and sections. The department service will be responsible for managing and storing information about various departments with in the college such as departments names, department Address, and department Code.
 
ii.	Students

Once the student has registered in college the administration provides them with user credentials to log into the system. A student will be responsible for storing information about individual students such as their personal details and information about academic issues.

iii.	Teacher

Teachers can take attendance by selecting the section of a given department they need. will also be able to modify the attendance of a student if wronged by chance, also will be responsible for managing and storing information about the teachers such as their personal details and about the information about the courses they teach.

iv.	Course

In the courses here looking for the how student and teachers composed on exchanging ideas like how many courses one student must take, also how many courses teacher must teach. But for our system we allow only one course for a teacher to take.

v.	Grade

This service will be responsible for managing and storing information about grades earned by students in different courses. This information will be used by other services with in the system such as student service and teachers.

Conclusion

This task is helpful for us because it enable us to gain new skills which did not have before like the spring boot framework, also the use of Postman further more this task encourage us to continue with work it doesnâ€™t matter how difficult and challenges we get also it provide us with confidence and ability to study new things.
